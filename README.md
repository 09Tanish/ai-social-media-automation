🤖 AI Social Media Automation System using n8n

The AI Social Media Automation System is designed to streamline and automate digital content creation and management using Artificial Intelligence and workflow automation tools. The system leverages the Gemini API for generating social media posts, newsletters, proposals, and invoices automatically based on predefined prompts and user requirements.

The automation workflow is implemented using n8n, an open-source workflow automation platform that integrates multiple services such as Gmail, Google Docs, and Brevo to create an end-to-end content generation and distribution pipeline. Once triggered, the system uses AI to generate relevant content for social media platforms, formats it accordingly, and schedules it for publishing or sends it through email newsletters.

Additionally, the system is capable of automatically generating professional proposals and invoices, reducing the manual effort involved in documentation and communication processes. Generated content is stored in Google Docs for easy access and editing, while newsletters are distributed via Brevo email services.

This project helps businesses and individuals maintain a consistent online presence without manual intervention, improving productivity and reducing time spent on repetitive tasks. By integrating AI-based content generation with automation workflows, the system ensures efficient digital communication and marketing processes.

Future enhancements may include integration with more social media platforms, real-time analytics dashboards, and customizable automation pipelines for different business needs.
